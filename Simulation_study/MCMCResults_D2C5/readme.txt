This directory contains example datasets for diagnostic functions, as outlined in Simulation_study/Sim_diagnostics_example.code.R. Please note that this example uses 4 chains, in contrast to the 100 chains used in the paper. When using these example data files, be sure to adjust the num_chains parameter in the diagnostics function from num_chains <- 100 to num_chains <- 4.

The file rep_a1.rds contains MCMC draws obtained after post-hoc relabeling, based on the code in Simulation_study/Sim_design.code.R. The file log_l.rds stores the corresponding log-likelihood values, calculated post-relabeling (see Simulation_study/log_l.R for the computation process). These files are provided as 4-chain examples for use with the diagnostic function. If desired, you may generate these files independently with your own configurations.
